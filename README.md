# 👋🏼Hi, I’m Karla Muñoz

## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!
### As a former educator turned aspiring Data Analyst, I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights, tell stories, and solve real-world problems. This repository showcases some of the SQL projects I've been working on as I grow my skills in querying, cleaning, and analyzing data.
📌 Here, you'll find examples of:
* SQL queries I've written for practice and projects
* Real-world scenarios I've explored using sample datasets
* My journey learning SQL as I transition into data analytics

Feel free to explore, connect, or reach out — I'm always excited to learn and collaborate!
